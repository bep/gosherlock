Gosherlock
==========

Joe Armstrong, the man behind Erlang, gave me this idea with his [Sherlock's last case](https://github.com/joearms/sherlock). The previous link points to some Erlang code of his, but to understand what he talks about, this [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh4tmDB9iQI)  may be better. 

**Joe states the Sherlock problem as given one X and millions of Yi’s, “Which Yi is “nearer to X?”**

When I write this, this README and some uncommitted prototype code is all there is.

## For Hugo
I wanted to find a way to show _related content_ using the static site generator [Hugo](http://gohugo.io).

So, even if this GitHub project has sat here, empty, for a while, the goal is still to create a usable _what's related_ feature for a web site. Not to _solve Sherlock's last case._

So, even if this _might_ become generally useful, it's foremost an attempt to write an add-on to Hugo.

And in that sense I'm going to consider more than just the content in the decision-making, and it should be user tweak-able:

1. Taxonomies (tags, categories)
2. Publish Date
3. Content
4. Title

**And as the title indicates, this is all written in Go.**
